Project 3 of Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


Goal of the project:
Recreating my own version of the frogger arcade game.


Functionality of the game:
The goal is for the player to reach the water, without colliding into any of the enemies. If the player collides into one of the enemies the game restarts. If the player reaches the water without colliding into one of the enemies the player wins. The player can move left, right, up and down on the board. The enemies move in varying speeds across the board.


How to play the game:
Use the arrow keys to move the Princess. You gain points when the Princess reaches the water. You loose points by colliding into a bug.
